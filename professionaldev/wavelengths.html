            <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Wavelengths is a community-building initiative designed to foster informal, cross-disciplinary connections within the 
                    extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) community. By facilitating small-group conversations across career stages, areas of 
                    expertise, and instrument teams, we aim to lower the barrier to meaningful professional relationships and shared scientific insight.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Promote low-effort, low-pressure, professional networking across the EPRV community.</li>
                    <li>Foster connections between early-career and more senior researchers.</li>
                    <li>Bridge gaps between subfields, such as instrumentation, data analysis, and theory.</li>
                    <li>Encourage cross-collaboration and awareness across international spectrograph teams.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Program Structure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants will be placed into small “pods” of 5-6 people, balanced across career stages, interests, and institutions.</li>
                    <li>Each pod will have one designated Pod Organizer (typically a mid-career or senior researcher) to facilitate meetings and help guide discussion.</li>
                    <li>Pods will meet every other month, either virtually or in person.</li>
                    <li>Each meeting will come with a suggested theme and optional discussion questions, provided by the RCN Steering Committee. 
                        Pods are encouraged but not required to follow these themes. Example themes includes: navigating job markets in different countries, 
                        sharing favorite tools or techniques, exciting new papers and what they mean for the field, etc</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Time Commitment</h3>
                <p>The first round of Wavelengths will run for 1 year, starting in Summer 2025, and include six meetings for each pod.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roughly 1 hour per meeting for all pod members</li>
                    <li>Additional 15-30 minutes per meeting for the pod organizer to handle coordination / logistics</li>
                    <li>Optional feedback surveys at the middle and end of the year</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Pod Member Expectations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foster a welcoming and respectful atmosphere.</li>
                    <li>Attend as many meetings as possible, but there is no requirement to attend every one.</li>
                    <li>Participate in discussions by sharing your experiences/expertise with fellow pod members!</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Pod Organizer Expectations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Schedule meetings and encourage participation (pod organizers are not expected to prepare presentations or carry the conversation).</li>
                    <li>Help connect pod members to the broader community when relevant. Organizers are encouraged to post in the #pod-organizers Slack channel to crowdsource advice.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Who Can Join / How To Sign Up</h3>
                <p>All members of the EPRV RCN are welcome, including observers, theorists, instrumentalists, and data scientists. 
                    We especially welcome participation from early-career researchers (graduate students, postdocs) and international colleagues.</p>
                
                <p>The first Wavelengths cohort has been established and the program commenced in July 2025! Calls for future cohorts will be sent out via the RCN mailing list.</p>
            <br>
