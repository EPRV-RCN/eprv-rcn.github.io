            The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Exploration Program,
            aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community
            as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.
        </p>

        <p>
            Membership is open to the community and we invite participants from all corners of the RV community and related fields,
            including but not limited to: observational efforts, instrumentation, data analysis techniques, solar studies,
            and stellar variability mitigation.
