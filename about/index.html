            The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASAâ€™s Exoplanet Exploration Program,
            aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community
            as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.
