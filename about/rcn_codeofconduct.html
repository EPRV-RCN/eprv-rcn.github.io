                  The Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network
                  (EPRV RCN) is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive
                  environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. We
                  do not tolerate discrimination, harassment or bullying based on
                  characteristics that include, but are not limited to, gender identity
                  and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
                  body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin,
                  pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information,
                  religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national
                  minority, age, education, socio-economic status, and experience
                  level.
                </p>

                <h2>Please follow these guidelines</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Behave professionally. Harassment, bullying and sexist, racist,
                        or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate.
                        Harassment and bullying include sustained disruption of talks
                        or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual
                        attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and
                        photography or recording of an individual without consent. It
                        also includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual
                        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race
                        or religion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All communication should be appropriate for a professional
                        audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual
                        language and imagery are not appropriate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
                        Critique ideas, not people.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be respectful of the intellectual property of others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If members wish to share photos or contents of un-published
                        research talks and/or presentations belonging to other members,
                        they must first get permission from the author.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    This Code of Conduct applies to all EPRV RCN discussions or
                    collaborations on any platform, either online or in-person. Anyone
                    who wishes to report a violation of our values or guidelines is asked
                    to contact a

                </p>

                <p>
                    Communications will be held in confidence where possible.

                    The Committee will normally give accused individuals an opportunity to respond to allegations.
