                <p>
                    Welcome to the home of the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network (EPRV RCN)! This website 
                    is meant to serve as a landing page for the EPRV community where members can come to access or contribute resources 
                    such as presentation recordings, software tools / tutorials, graphics & animations, and useful literature references. 
                    We're in the early days of development and expect new areas to be created and populated by the community over the 
                    coming months.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    If there are areas of the website that you're interested in contributing to, we encourage you to engage 
                    via the Gitflow workflow outlined at the bottom of this page! If you have questions, or resources you'd like to 
                    contribute without tackling the github lifestyle, you can reach out to our website oversight team at: eprv.rcn-website [at] jpl.nasa.gov

                <h3>RCN Overview</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program,
                    aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community
                    as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Membership is open to the community and we invite participants from all corners of the RV community and related fields,
                    including but not limited to: observational efforts, instrumentation, data analysis techniques, solar studies,
                    and stellar variability mitigation. Please see the sidebar for instructions and links on how to join the RCN.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> All members of the EPRV RCN will be required to follow our <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.

                <h3>How to contribute to the RCN Website</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>This site follows the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow">Gitflow workflow</a></p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Branch Structure</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>main</em> -- Release branch from which the current, displayed website is generated</li>
                        <li><em>develop</em> -- Development branch where updates are aggregated between releases</li>
                        <li><em>feature_branch_name</em> - Feature branches should be forked off of develop, and should be named with a human readable intuitive name. Delete feature branches once merged into develop and work in them is complete.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <strong>Developers</strong> 
                    We recommend that developers use the following workflow: <br>
                    First, set up your working environment
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a fork of the repository into your github account by clicking the Fork icon on the right top corner of the main github EPRV-RCN/RVdata repo page.</li>
                        <li>Clone your fork to your local computer: <code>git clone git@github.com:YourGithubID/RVdata.git</code></li>
                        <li>Setup a new <em>remote</em> named upstream that points to the project level repository: <code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:EPRV-RCN/RVdata.git</code></li>
                    </ol>

                    To add a new feature or bugfix to the website:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a feature branch off of develop for your new work. Bugfix branches should prefix with <em>bugfix</em></li>
                        <code>git checkout -b feature_branch_name</code>
                        <li>Make your changes, commit them with a useful commit message, and push to your fork.</li>
                        <code>git commit -m "Description of committed changes"</code>  <br>
                        <code>git push origin feature_branch_name</code>
                        <li>Setup a pull request from your feature branch into the project level develop branch. Use the Pull requests menu item on the top bar of github.com. 
                            Be sure that the pull request points into the EPRV-RCN.github.io <em><strong>develop</strong></em> branch. This will trigger a review request.</li>
                        <li>Iterate with reviewers as needed, using the pull request to capture discussion comments. Once the reviewers approve the pull request, the original 
                            author is responsible for merging. <strong>If you encounter a merge conflict, ask for help. Do not proceed!</strong></li>
                    </ol>
