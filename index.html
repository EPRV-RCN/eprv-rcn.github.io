                <p>
                    Welcome to the home of the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network (EPRV RCN)! This website 
                    is meant to serve as a landing page for the EPRV community where members can come to access or contribute resources 
                    such as presentation recordings, software tools / tutorials, graphics & animations, and useful literature references. 
                    We're in the early days of development and expect new areas to be created and populated by the community over the 
                    coming months.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    If there are areas of the website that you're interested in contributing to, we encourage you to engage 
                    via the Gitflow workflow outlined on the <a href="/about/webdev.html">Website Development page</a>! If you have questions, or resources you'd like to 
                    contribute without tackling the github lifestyle, you can reach out to our website oversight team at: eprv.rcn-website [at] jpl.nasa.gov
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Not sure where to start? Consider: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding yourself to the public facing <a href="https://eprv-rcn.github.io/about/rcn_directory.html" target="_blank">RCN Directory</a> so that community members can identify potential new collaborators.</li>
                        <li>Adding to the <a href="https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/tutorials/index.html" target="_blank">Tutorials</a> page where we're aiming to compile useful examples of code for all areas of EPRV science from data downloads, data reduction, stellar variability analyses, planet fitting, etc.</li>
                        <li>Suggesting papers on the <a href="https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/ads-libraries/index.html" target="_blank">EPRV ADS Libraries</a> page.</li>
                        <li>Adding figures or animations that you've developed to the <a href="https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/visuals/index.html" target="_blank">Visual Resources</a> page.</li>
                        <li>Developing new sections/pages that fit within the EPRV Resources or Professional Development umbrellas (e.g., outlines of how to write compelling EPRV observing proposals or compiling lists of funding opportunities that cover EPRV science or instrumentation).</li>
                        <li>Nominating yourself or a collaborator to give an <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSca51ngoFeF5X9EZbTintxS3jKpfOYXPdjR_rjT86MLb-CC1A/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">RCN Colloquium.</a></li>
                        <li>Suggesting a topic for a future <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdlAf-hi9BQWcLHL-PpuFTYZVTdsPbMiIw3Edjc1RiAaXQvQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank">RCN Workshop.</a></li>

                <h3>RCN Overview</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program,
                    aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community
                    as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Membership is open to the community and we invite participants from all corners of the RV community and related fields,
                    including but not limited to: observational efforts, instrumentation, data analysis techniques, solar studies,
                    and stellar variability mitigation.
                </p>
    
                 <p>Sign up for the RCN using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEi057QAcAfiRDKt95CylO8bqQE5Jm1s2Rkw137Hje3lvqfg/viewform" target="_blank">this Google form.</a> 
                    Membership provides access to the RCN mailing list, Google Calendar, Slack workspace, and Google Drive.
                <p>

                <strong>Note:</strong> All members of the EPRV RCN will be required to follow our <a href="/about/rcn_codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
