                <p>
                    Welcome to the home of the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network (EPRV RCN)! This website 
                    is meant to serve as a landing page for the EPRV community where members can come to access or contribute resources 
                    such as presentation recordings, software tools / tutorials, graphics & animations, and useful literature references. 
                    We're in the early days of development and expect new areas to be created and populated by the community over the 
                    coming months.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    If there are areas of the website that you're interested in contributing to, we encourage you to engage 
                    via the Gitflow workflow outlined on the <a href="/about/webdev.html">Website Development page</a>! If you have questions, or resources you'd like to 
                    contribute without tackling the github lifestyle, you can reach out to our website oversight team at: eprv.rcn-website [at] jpl.nasa.gov

                  <strong>Abstract:</strong> CHORUS (Canary Hybrid Optical high-Resolution Ultra-stable Spectrograph) is a next-generation extreme precision radial velocity instrument 
                  for the 10-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias, designed to reach 10 cm/s precision. CHORUS features a dual-arm design with a UV arm (310-420 nm, R~25,000) 
                  and a visual arm (420-780 nm, R~120,000). The expected science programs include PRV surveys of nearby stars, follow-up of transit discoveries, characterization 
                  of exoplanet atmospheres, finding stars with primordial composition, and galactic archaeology. I will introduce the CHORUS project and the ongoing precursor 
                  science programs focusing on refining target selection and mitigating stellar activity to improve detection sensitivity, and we invite the community to join 
                  these efforts in preparation for the science operation starting in 2028.

                <p>
                    The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program,
                    aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community
                    as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Membership is open to the community and we invite participants from all corners of the RV community and related fields,
                    including but not limited to: observational efforts, instrumentation, data analysis techniques, solar studies,
                    and stellar variability mitigation.
                </p>
