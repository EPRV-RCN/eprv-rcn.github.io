    "description": "A figure showing the progression of radial velocity precision over time and the semi-amplitudes of the exoplanets discovered each year. RV-only detections are depicted as squares, while planets detected first in transit and then followed up with RV facilities are depicted as circles.

    "description": "An animation showing the temporal evolution of the Solar surface temperature as simulated by the STAGGER code. The simulation is of box-in-a-star type, contains no magnetic fields an encompasses roughly 0.004% of the Solar surface. Longer (or other customised) versions of this movie are available on request to cis.lagae@warwick.ac.uk.",
