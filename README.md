## About This Website

Welcome to the home of the Extreme Precision Radial Velocity Research Coordination Network (EPRV RCN)! This website is meant to serve as a landing page for the EPRV community where members can come to access or contribute resources such as presentation recordings, software tools / tutorials, graphics & animations, and useful literature references. We're in the early days of development and expect new areas to be created and populated by the community over the coming months.

The EPRV Research Coordination Network (RCN), sponsored by NASA's [Exoplanet Exploration Program](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/exep), aims to support increased communication and collaboration within the radial velocity community as we work towards the goal of obtaining robust mass measurements for Earth analog planets.

Membership is open to the community and we invite participants from all corners of the RV community and related fields, including but not limited to: observational efforts, instrumentation, data analysis techniques, solar studies, and stellar variability mitigation. If you're interested in joining, please use this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEi057QAcAfiRDKt95CylO8bqQE5Jm1s2Rkw137Hje3lvqfg/viewform) to submit a membership request.

Note: All members of the EPRV RCN will be required to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/about/rcn_codeofconduct.html).


## How to Contribute

If there are areas of the website that you're interested in contributing to, we encourage you to engage using the Gitflow workflow outlined on the [Website Development](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/about/webdev.html) page!  If you have questions, or resources you'd like to contribute without tackling the github lifestyle, you can reach out to our website oversight team at: eprv.rcn-website [at] jpl.nasa.gov

#### Suggested Contribution Areas

We welcome contributions and upgrades to all areas of this website, but if you're looking for suggestions of where to start please consider:

1. Adding yourself to the public facing [RCN Directory](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/about/rcn_directory.html) so that community members can identify potential new collaborators
2. Adding to the [Tutorials](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/tutorials/index.html) page where we're aiming to compile useful examples of code for all areas of EPRV science from data downloads, data reduction, stellar variability analyses, planet fitting, etc.
3. Suggesting papers on the [EPRV ADS Libraries](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/ads-libraries/index.html) page
4. Adding figures or animations that you've developed to the [Visual Resources](https://eprv-rcn.github.io/resources/visuals/index.html) page
5. Developing new sections/pages that fit within the EPRV Resources or Professional Development umbrellas (e.g., outlines of how to write compelling EPRV observing proposals or compiling lists of funding opportunities that cover EPRV science or instrumentation)
