## Pre-PR Checklist

Please complete this checklist before requesting review.  
PRs may be delayed if items are unchecked.

Always Required:
- [ ] This PR makes one focused change
- [ ] I edited the correct source file
- [ ] I checked that any new links lead to the correct page/website/etc

If adding a new page:
- [ ] I checked that the “Interested in improving this page?" source file link at the bottom of the page works and points to the correct page
- [ ] If appropriate, I added the page to the navbar.html file so it shows up in the navigation bar

## Summary

Briefly describe what you changed and why.
